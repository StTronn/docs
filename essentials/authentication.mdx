## Overview

The Nolano API uses API key authentication to secure access to all endpoints. This ensures that only authorized users can access your forecasting data and manage API resources.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

All forecast endpoints use API key authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forecast \
  -H "Authorization: ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### JWT Authentication (Management Endpoints)

API key management endpoints require Clerk JWT authentication:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keys/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## API Key Format

Nolano API keys follow a specific format for easy identification:

```
ak_[64_character_hex_string]
```

**Example:**
```
ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6
```

## Security Features

### Secure Storage

- API keys are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- Only the hash is stored in the database
- The original key is never stored in plain text

### Usage Tracking

Every API call is tracked with detailed metrics:

- **Usage Count**: Total number of requests made
- **Last Used**: Timestamp of the most recent request
- **Request Patterns**: Monitoring for unusual activity

### Permission System

API keys support fine-grained permissions:

## Getting Your API Key

### Contact Support

For new API keys, contact our support team:

ðŸ“§ **Email**: [support@nolano.com](mailto:support@nolano.com)

Include the following information:
- Your intended use case
- Expected request volume
- Required permissions

### Self-Service (Coming Soon)

We're building a self-service dashboard where you'll be able to:
- Create and manage API keys
- Monitor usage statistics
- Set custom permissions and expiration dates

## Error Handling

### Common Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="x-mark" title="401 Unauthorized">
    **Cause**: Invalid, missing, or expired API key
    
    **Solution**: 
    - Verify your API key is correct
    - Check if the key has expired
    - Ensure you're using the `Authorization` header
    
    ```bash
    # Correct format
    -H "Authorization: ak_your_key_here"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x-mark" title="403 Forbidden">
    **Cause**: API key lacks required permissions
    
    **Solution**: 
    - Check your key's permissions
    - Contact support to upgrade permissions if needed
    - Use a different key with appropriate permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x-mark" title="429 Rate Limited">
    **Cause**: Too many requests in a short time period
    
    **Solution**: 
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Reduce request frequency
    - Consider upgrading to a higher tier plan

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management

1. **Store Securely**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for key storage
3. **Rotate Regularly**: Rotate keys periodically for security
4. **Minimize Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions
5. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review key usage patterns

### Request Security

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS for API requests
2. **Secure Headers**: Include proper headers in requests
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose keys in error messages

### Example: Secure Storage

```bash
# .env file
NOLANO_API_KEY=ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6

# In your application
api_key = os.environ.get('NOLANO_API_KEY')
headers = {'Authorization': api_key}
```

## Rate Limits

Different subscription tiers have different rate limits:

| Tier | Requests/Minute | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Free** | 10 | 100 | 1,000 |
| **Standard** | 100 | 1,000 | 50,000 |
| **Premium** | 500 | 5,000 | 250,000 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom |

### Rate Limit Headers

API responses include rate limit information:

```bash
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Testing Authentication

### Quick Test

Test your API key with a simple request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forecast \
  -H "Authorization: ak_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "authentication"}' \
  -v
```

### Expected Response

A successful authentication will return either:
- **200 OK**: Your request was processed
- **500 Server Error**: Authentication succeeded, but the target API is unreachable

An authentication failure will return:
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key
