## What are API Keys?

API keys are unique identifiers that authenticate your requests to the Nolano API. They act as both an identifier and a password, ensuring that only authorized users can access forecasting services and manage API resources.

## Key Features

### Secure by Design

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SHA-256 Hashing" icon="shield-check">
    Keys are hashed before storage - original keys are never stored in plain text
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Tracking" icon="chart-bar">
    Every API call is logged with detailed usage statistics and monitoring
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expiration Control" icon="clock">
    Set custom expiration dates or create keys that never expire
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Revocation" icon="x-mark">
    Immediately revoke compromised keys with audit trails
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Key Lifecycle

### Creation

API keys are created through the management endpoints with custom configurations:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keys/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Production Forecasting",
    "permissions": ["read", "write"],
    "expires_at": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

### Active Usage

Once created, use your API key for all forecast requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forecast \
  -H "Authorization: ak_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"series": [1,2,3,4,5], "forecast_periods": 3}'
```

### Rotation

Safely rotate keys without service interruption:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keys/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_id": "1751308234318",
    "grace_period_hours": 48
  }'
```

### Revocation

Immediately revoke keys when needed:

```bash
curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keys/revoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_id": "1751308234318",
    "reason": "Security audit"
  }'
```

## Usage Monitoring

### Key Metrics

Every API key tracks detailed usage information:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Usage Count" icon="calculator">
    Total number of API requests made with this key
  </Card>
  <Card title="Last Used" icon="clock">
    Timestamp of the most recent API request
  </Card>
  <Card title="Status" icon="signal">
    Current status: active, expired, or revoked
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Viewing Usage Statistics

```bash
curl -X GET https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "keys": [{
    "id": "1751308234318",
    "name": "Production API Key",
    "usage_count": 1847,
    "last_used": "2024-01-22T15:45:30Z",
    "status": "active"
  }]
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### Storage and Handling

<Warning>
**Never expose API keys in client-side code**: API keys should only be used in server-side applications where they can be kept secure.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in your source code.
</Note>

```bash
# ✅ Good: Environment variable
export NOLANO_API_KEY="ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6"

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded in source
api_key = "ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6"
```

### Regular Rotation

Implement a regular key rotation schedule:

1. **Production Keys**: Rotate every 90 days
2. **Development Keys**: Rotate every 30 days
3. **Emergency Rotation**: Immediately if compromise suspected

### Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Separate Keys**: Use different keys for different environments
- **Team Management**: Individual keys for team members when possible

## Common Use Cases

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Development environment
NOLANO_DEV_KEY="ak_dev_key_with_read_write_permissions"

# Staging environment  
NOLANO_STAGING_KEY="ak_staging_key_with_read_write_permissions"

# Production environment
NOLANO_PROD_KEY="ak_prod_key_with_minimal_required_permissions"
```

### Microservices Architecture

```bash
# Forecasting service (read/write)
FORECASTING_API_KEY="ak_forecasting_service_key"

# Analytics service (read only)
ANALYTICS_API_KEY="ak_analytics_service_key"

# Admin panel (admin permissions)
ADMIN_API_KEY="ak_admin_panel_key"
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
env:
  NOLANO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NOLANO_API_KEY }}

steps:
  - name: Test API Integration
    run: |
      curl -X POST ${{ env.API_BASE_URL }}/forecast \
        -H "Authorization: $NOLANO_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"test": "ci_integration"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Key Not Working">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Key has expired
    - Key has been revoked
    - Insufficient permissions
    - Incorrect format
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check key status via GET /keys
    - Verify permissions match your needs
    - Ensure proper Authorization header format
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Rate Limiting">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Too many requests per minute
    - Burst usage beyond limits
    - Multiple services using same key
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Distribute load across multiple keys
    - Upgrade to higher tier plan
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Permission Denied">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Key lacks required permissions
    - Attempting admin operations with basic key
    - Using expired or revoked key
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check key permissions
    - Use appropriate key for operation
    - Contact support for permission upgrades
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits by Key Type

| Permission Level | Requests/Min | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Read Only** | 50 | 500 | 10,000 |
| **Read/Write** | 100 | 1,000 | 50,000 |
| **Admin** | 200 | 2,000 | 100,000 |
| **Full Access** | 500 | 5,000 | 250,000 |

<Tip>
