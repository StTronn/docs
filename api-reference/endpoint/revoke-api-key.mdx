### Important Notes

<Warning>
  **Irreversible Action**: Once an API key is revoked, it cannot be reactivated. You'll need to create a new API key if access is required again.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Immediate Effect**: Revocation takes effect immediately. Any subsequent requests using the revoked key will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
</Note>

### Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and revoke unused API keys
2. **Incident Response**: Immediately revoke keys suspected of being compromised
3. **Rotation**: Revoke old keys when rotating to new ones
4. **Documentation**: Always provide a reason for audit trails

### Rate Limits

- Maximum 10 revocation requests per hour per user
- No limit on the number of keys that can be revoked
