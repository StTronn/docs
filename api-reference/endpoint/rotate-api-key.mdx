### Key Rotation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate New Key">
    A new API key is created with the same permissions as the original
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grace Period">
    Both keys remain active for the specified grace period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Applications">
    Update your applications to use the new API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Cleanup">
    The old key is automatically revoked after the grace period
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important Notes

<Warning>
  **Store the new API key securely**: The new API key is only displayed once during rotation. Make sure to save it before updating your applications.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Grace Period**: The old key will be automatically revoked after the grace period expires. Plan your migration accordingly.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Zero Downtime**: Key rotation allows for zero-downtime transitions by keeping both keys active during the migration period.
</Tip>

### Best Practices

1. **Plan Migration**: Schedule rotation during low-traffic periods when possible
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track which key is being used to ensure successful migration
3. **Grace Period**: Use longer grace periods for critical production systems
4. **Immediate Updates**: Update applications as soon as possible after rotation
5. **Verify New Key**: Test the new key before relying on it completely

### Rate Limits

- Maximum 5 rotation requests per hour per user
- Grace period cannot exceed 168 hours (7 days)
- Maximum 2 concurrent active keys per rotation (old + new)
