## Getting Started with Nolano

Learn how to make your first forecast request and manage API keys.

### Get Your API Key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Obtain an API Key">
    To use the Nolano API, you need a valid API key. Contact our support team at
    [support@nolano.com](mailto:support@nolano.com) to get your API key, or use
    the API key management endpoints if you already have access.
    
    Your API key will look like:
    ```
    ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Test Your Authentication">
    Test your API key with a simple request to ensure it's working correctly:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forecast \
      -H "Authorization: your_api_key_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"test": "authentication"}'
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Make sure to include your API key in the `Authorization` header. The API uses
      secure authentication to protect your data and ensure reliable access.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Make Your First Forecast

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Send Time Series Data">
  Once your API key is validated, you can send time series data for forecasting.
  Here's an example request with sample time series data:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://enbfcx4kq6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forecast \
    -H "Authorization: ak_577aa2f186866ec0c75d1068bcff79cd3da4344b80aec1572e0fa07b364227d6" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "series": [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30],
      "forecast_periods": 5,
      "confidence_level": 0.95
    }'
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="arrow-down" title="Receive Forecast Results">
  The API will respond with forecast predictions, confidence intervals, and metadata:
  
  ```json
  {
    "forecast": [32, 35, 38, 41, 44],
    "confidence_intervals": {
      "lower": [29, 31, 33, 35, 37],
      "upper": [35, 39, 43, 47, 51]
    },
    "model_info": {
      "model_type": "ARIMA",
      "accuracy_metrics": {
        "mape": 5.2,
        "rmse": 1.8
